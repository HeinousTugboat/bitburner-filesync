# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! This project would not be what it is without the support of the community.

## Issues
- If reporting a bug, please include the operating system used, any relevant information about the tech stack, and the configuration used.

## Pull requests
- Code contributions should match the existing code style.
- Discuss additions/changes with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/Dq43JNys6J) before working on them.
- Check to make sure someone hasn't worked on the same thing already.
- Make pull requests from a feature branch on your own fork instead of from `main`.
