# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing! This project would not be what it is without the support of the community.

## Issues

- If reporting a bug, please include the operating system used, any relevant information about the tech stack, and the configuration used.

## Pull requests

- Before opening the PR, make sure you've built and run it, done the tests locally, and run the formatter/linter.
- Feel free to pop in on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Dq43JNys6J) to ask for help or clarification on anything related to this project.
- If possible, check that someone else hasn't recently said that they've taken up an issue.
- Try to keep your PR focused on a single feature/bug/etc, don't mix them together.
- Make pull requests from a feature branch on your own fork instead of from `main`.
